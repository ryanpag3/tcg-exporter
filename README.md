# tcg-exporter

This project, while working, is a WIP and not very user friendly. 

It's an attempt to leverage TCGPlayers scanner ability to export to a number of card management solutions using csv transforming.

I'm currently pretty unhappy with how dependent on one-off hacks it needs so I'm pausing development. If you find a way around needing to use files like `set-replace.json` please let me know.
